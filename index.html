<h1> What is really wrong with this website
<br> www.specialequest.org?</h1>
<p id="link">Here is the link to check the website <a href ="http://www.specialequest.org">
Go to the website</a> </p>
<p id="italic">Thanks to Frances!</p>
<p>The website looks ok with a lot of pictures, videos, links to facebook, twitter,... but has a few flaws:</p>

<h2> Made in Wix</h2>
<p>So I don't know really what Wix really does but it added every css just
inline in stead of using a extra extern file for CSS.</p>
<p>They used like 48 <span><id="italic"> inline stylesheets.</span></p>
<p> Is it really necessary?</p>
<p>There is a javascript but <b>certain</b> variables are empty, but i don't know why.</p>

<h2> Used lettertypes </h2>
<ul>
<li>Din-Next-WO1 Light</li>
<li>Liberation Sans</li>
</ul>
<p>Never heard of them, no standard. In the picture below, you can see the used fonts.</p>

<h2> Miss extra fonctions </h2>

<p>I miss extra accessibility tools for people with a disability.</p>
<p>A speech voice reader, braille, ... would be nice for the people with a disability.</p>
